		The TPM is a hardware module that can lock your encryption keys

		You need to enter a PIN to unlock your encryption keys and the TPM
		will lock you out after several failed authentication attempts.
		The PIN can contain any character, not just numbers.

		The TPM support in dirlock is functional but still basic and under development.
		If unsure, say no. You can always start using the TPM later.

This tool will encrypt the $user_home directory using the dirlock tool.

You should be running this tool as root from an ssh connection.
It's important that you ssh directly as root rather than using sudo from
a regular '$user_name' user session.

The following tasks will be performed now:

- The display manager will be stopped and the current session will be closed.
- $user_home will be encrypted (you will need to enter a new PIN or password)
- The old password for the '$user_name' account will be disabled (you will need to use
  the encryption PIN or password from now on)
- The system will be rebooted
