Subject: [PATCH] avahi-daemon.conf: turn off wide-area

In its current form it doesn't interact with mDNS well. For example
services advertised over mDNS where PTR RRs point "_services._dns-sd._udp.local"
to unresolvable wide-area domain names bring down mDNS browsers. DNS
isn't supported well either. For example responses larger than 512 bytes
aren't supported, all the queries come from the same UDP port and so on.
All in all in its current form it isn't something that should be enabled
by default or picked up accidentally by packages downstream.

It reverts the part of 2c453196ee040e17e357f3431b0647391c88d616 where
that feature was turned on.
